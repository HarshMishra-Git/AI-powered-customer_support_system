## 7. Key Interview Questions and Answers

### 7.1 Architecture and Design

**Q: What were the main considerations in choosing a multi-agent architecture?**

**A**: The multi-agent architecture was chosen for several key reasons:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each agent has a focused responsibility, making the system modular and maintainable.

2. **Specialized Optimization**: Each agent can be optimized independently for its specific task.

3. **Parallel Development**: The team could work on different agents simultaneously.

4. **Graceful Degradation**: If one agent fails, others can continue functioning.

5. **Flexible Scaling**: High-demand components can be scaled independently.

6. **Iterative Improvement**: Individual agents can be upgraded without affecting the entire system.

This approach also maps well to how human support teams work, with different specialists handling specific aspects of customer support.

### 7.2 ML Implementation

**Q: How do you balance ML model complexity with operational requirements?**

**A**: Balancing ML model complexity with operational needs involves:

1. **Performance Benchmarking**: We establish minimum acceptable performance thresholds for each model.

2. **Complexity Budget**: We allocate computational resources based on the criticality of each function.

3. **Progressive Deployment**: We start with simpler models and increase complexity only where needed.

4. **Runtime Profiling**: We monitor latency and resource usage in production.

5. **Caching Strategies**: Frequently requested predictions are cached to reduce computation.

6. **Model Pruning and Quantization**: Production models are optimized for inference efficiency.

7. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Simpler, more reliable models serve as backups for complex ones.

8. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Each increase in model complexity must justify its operational cost.

This balanced approach ensures we deliver the best possible user experience while maintaining system reliability and efficiency.

### 7.3 Knowledge Base

**Q: How does your system ensure the knowledge base remains accurate and current?**

**A**: Our knowledge base maintains accuracy through:

1. **Feedback-Driven Curation**: Solutions that receive positive feedback are promoted, while those with negative feedback are flagged.

2. **Success Rate Tracking**: Each solution's effectiveness is tracked and used to determine prominence.

3. **Automatic Creation**: Only resolved tickets with high satisfaction ratings become knowledge base entries.

4. **Staleness Detection**: Entries unused for extended periods are reviewed automatically.

5. **Version Tracking**: Solutions are updated rather than duplicated when procedures change.

6. **Category Monitoring**: We detect when categories become over or under-represented.

7. **Human Review**: Scheduled reviews by subject matter experts ensure technical accuracy.

8. **User Engagement Metrics**: Views, helpfulness ratings, and application success are tracked.

This combination of automated metrics and strategic human oversight ensures the knowledge base remains a reliable, current resource.

### 7.4 Privacy and Security

**Q: What approach did you take to ensure customer data privacy in your AI system?**

**A**: Data privacy is a cornerstone of our design:

1. **On-Premise Processing**: All LLM operations occur within our infrastructure, preventing data exposure.

2. **Data Minimization**: We process only the information necessary for each specific function.

3. **Role-Based Access**: Strict controls limit who can access what data, even within the system.

4. **Anonymization**: When using data for training, we remove or obscure personal identifiers.

5. **Consent Framework**: Clear disclosure of automated processing with opt-out paths.

6. **Time-Limited Storage**: Conversation data has defined retention periods.

7. **Query Isolation**: Knowledge base searches use minimal context to reduce exposure.

8. **Audit Trails**: All data access and processing is logged for accountability.
